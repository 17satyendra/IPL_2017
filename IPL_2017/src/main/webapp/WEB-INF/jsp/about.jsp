	  <div><b>Editorial Staff Profiles</b></div><br>
	   <div><b>AnandSubramaniam </b></div><br>
	   
	  <div> Anand Subramaniam has been fascinated by the game of
	cricket right since his childhood and over the years his passion to
	follow the game has only grown. Having acquired a degree in Mass Media
	and specialisation in journalism, he has been in the media industry for
	over six years now. Having spent two years in print media and close to
	four years in broadcast, Anand now looks to add value to the web team
	of BCCI. Apart from cricket, he takes keen interest in tennis. His
	major hobbies lie in photography and traveling. </div><br>
	
	<div><b>Prajakta Pawar Prajakta</b></div><br>
	<div>Pawar’s passion for sports saw her give up a career in Social Work and
	take up sports journalism. She joined BCCI immediately after completing
	her journalism course and has been diligently following and writing
	about Cricket ever since. She has also been keenly tracking the
	domestic circuit and women’s cricket for the past couple of years.</div><br>

	<div><b>Rajneesh Gupta</b></div> <br>
	<div>Rajneesh Gupta is one of the most outstanding Cricket
	statisticians of modern time, with his unique style of presenting
	Cricket facts and figures. His mastery across various media platforms –
	electronic, print, LIVE TV production – is mindboggling. Ever since he
	joined the editorial team, Rajneesh has played an important part in the
	site’s popularity with his in-depth analysis and superior research. His
	role requires him to keep a tab on each and every development in all
	formats of the game; but he has no qualms in admitting that it is the
	shortest version of Cricket that fascinates him the most.</div><br>
	 <div><b>ArunGopalakrishnan</b></div> 
	 <br>
	 <div>Arun Gopalakrishnan was bitten by the Cricket bug during
	his formative years when he spent almost every weekend playing tennis
	ball Cricket. That passion and hunger only increased as he grew up, and
	he took to playing league cricket in Bangalore. When realization dawned
	on him that he was going nowhere where playing was concerned, he took
	to other avenues within the ambit of the game. He is sort of an
	all-rounder where Cricket is concerned; apart from being a freelance
	journalist, he is also a statistician, a State Panel Umpire in
	Bangalore, an International Panel Scorer and a keen analyst of the
	game. Unlike many in his age-group – early 30s – he is a Test cricket
	romantic and prefers prolonged contests between bat and ball. Put
	briefly, cricket is life for him – everything else comes next.</div></h6>
